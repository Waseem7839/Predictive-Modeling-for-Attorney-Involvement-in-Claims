# ⚖️ Predictive Modeling for Attorney Involvement in Insurance Claims

This project aims to predict whether an attorney will be involved in an insurance claim using supervised machine learning techniques. Early prediction of attorney involvement can help insurance companies optimize resource allocation and reduce legal expenses.

## 📌 Objective

- Build a predictive model to classify claims based on attorney involvement.
- Identify key factors that influence attorney participation.
- Provide actionable insights through data visualization.
- Deploy the model using a Streamlit application for user-friendly interaction.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data Wrangling
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning (Classification Models)
- **XGBoost / RandomForest / Logistic Regression** – Algorithms Used
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Streamlit** – Deployment

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🔍 Approach
